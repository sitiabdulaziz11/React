// setIsEditing(!isEditing);
// if our new state depends on our previous state CSSMathValue, we should not update the state directly like this. we should use or pass funcn to our setState updating function. 

// the funcn will automatically be called by react and will receive the latest new state value.

// e.g setIsEditing(wasEditing => !wasEditing);
